## VR Draw testing in the editor

It always takes time to run and test in the Oculus device so instead I provide you with a few tools to help you test your changes within Unity.

### Key Mappings in the Unity Editor
* Left arrow, right arrow, down arrow, up arrow - Movement
* Press Z - Emulates shooting
* Press X - Emulates changing the weapon
